					<p>
					War Company is an upcoming and in progress medieval warfare RTS game, currently being developed in CryEngine. War Company extends upon the Regicide project from Unity that will bring more in-depth systems on a higher optimized level. For mor details about Regicide, you can find the project page <a href="./projects/regicide.html"">here</a>. The progress of War Company can be tracked on the Github page <a href="https://github.com/Max-Light/WarCompany" target="_blank">here</a>.
					</p> 
					<p>
					The game intends to improve upon Regicide's battle formation system. The battle formation system is a feature that allows players to group units with other units in order to improve battle effectiveness. The system includes an in-game spline tool for players to customize their formation shapes. War Comapny's spline tool plans to have a free formed spline across all units in a single battle line. In addition, it will support formations that have stacked battle lines. Stay tuned for more updates in the future!
